### üßê How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Document Loading:**\
Your resume is uploaded and processed using PyMuPDFLoader to extract text.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Text Splitting & Vector Storage:**\
The extracted resume content is chunked and converted into embeddings via HuggingFace, then stored in ChromaDB.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval:**\
A relevant portion of your resume is retrieved based on your query using similarity search.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM Processing:**\
The job description, retrieved resume chunks, and your question are sent to Google's Gemini model, which provides a detailed HR-style answer.
